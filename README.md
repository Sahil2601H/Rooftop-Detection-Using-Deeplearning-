# Rooftop-Detection-Using-Deeplearning
Rooftop detection using deep learning involves employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify and segment rooftops in  aerial or satellite imagery. The process typically includes collecting a labeled dataset, training the model to recognize features  characteristic of rooftops, for implementation of a solar panel .

# Image Segmentation with TensorFlow and OpenCV

This project performs image segmentation using a **U-Net model** trained with TensorFlow. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing and NumPy for data manipulation.

##  Features
- **Deep Learning Model:** U-Net architecture with TensorFlow  
- **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization  
- **Post-processing:** Overlaying masks on original images  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib for displaying results  

## ðŸ›  Requirements
Ensure you have Python **3.8** installed. Then, install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
