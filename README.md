# Rooftop-Detection-Using-Deeplearning-
Rooftop detection using deep learning involves employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify and segment rooftops in  aerial or satellite imagery. The process typically includes collecting a labeled dataset, training the model to recognize features  characteristic of rooftops, for implementation of a solar panel .
